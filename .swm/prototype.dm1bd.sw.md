## Introduction

In this version, I implemented a basic web server engine with a map as the router.

## Main features

Define an Engine Type and a HandlerFunc type. To make the engine type as a http.Handler type. I implemented a method called ServeHttp. What it does is check the request method and URL path to map to the correct handler function.

```go
// A Handler responds to an HTTP request.
type Handler interface {
	ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}
```

## Interface

<br/>

New() function to create a new engine.

### ðŸ“„ gu/gu.go
```go
14     func New() *Engine {
15     	return &Engine{router: make(map[string]HandlerFunc)}
16     }
17     
```

<br/>

Use GET() and POST() methods to add router and handler functions to the engine.

```go
23     func (e *Engine) GET(pattern string, handler HandlerFunc) {
24     	e.addRoute("GET", pattern, handler)
25     }
26     
27     func (e *Engine) POST(pattern string, handler HandlerFunc) {
28     	e.addRoute("POST", pattern, handler)
29     }
```
